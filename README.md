# ⚙️ Setup Instructions

## 🔹 Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
```

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 💻 Runtime Configuration

The system automatically adapts based on your hardware:

---

## 🟢 GPU Available

* Uses **MedGemma (Google medical LLM)**
* High-quality medical reasoning
* Faster inference with CUDA

---

## 🟡 CPU Only

Uses **Ollama-based local inference**

---

### 🔥 Install Ollama

👉 https://ollama.com

---

### 🔥 Pull Model

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:latest
```

---

### 🔥 Start Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
```

---

# ▶️ Running the Pipeline

Once setup is complete:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

# 📥 Input Data

Place DICOM files here:

```
data/input/dicom/
```

---

## 🔁 Using Your Own Data

To use custom data:

* Replace files in `data/input/dicom/`
* Ensure they are **multi-frame angiography DICOM videos**
* Supported format:

  * IM0.dcm
  * IM1.dcm
  * IM2.dcm
